## Getting Super Powers

Git and Bash hands on

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

## installing git

```
$ give me super-powers
```

```text
$ sudo apt install -y git-all
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

## create a new branch

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```text
$ git checkout -b <name>
```

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
